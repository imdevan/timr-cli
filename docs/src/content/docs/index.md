A generic CLI tool template built with Go, Cobra, and Bubble Tea. This template provides a foundation for building interactive command-line applications with a clean architecture and modern UI components.

## Features

- Interactive list with filtering
- [Built on go Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- Configuration management with TOML
- Styles, build scripts, and tests to get you started.
- [Inline Bubble Tea TUI components](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- Homebrew and aur package management with TOML too!
- Automatic documentation with [gomarkdoc](https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc) and [astro starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)
  - With automated github deployment workflow
- [Just](https://just.systems/) recipes to build and release to your favorite package manager
  - homebrew tap, AUR, Github release, and manual download are currently supported
- XDG Base Directory support
- Utils for NerdFont, and Editor interaction
- Integration and unit tested
- Shell completion (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)

## Author's Note

This project was created by deconstructing another cli tool I created: [prompter-cli](https://devan.gg/prompter-cli), a cli tool to organize prompts and skills. I wanted a reusable way to create go cli tools that were fast and looked pretty.

I then used this project to bootstrap [bookmark](https://devan.gg/bookmark), a go based approach to organize shell aliases. I then took what I learned building bookmark and incorporated those learnings back into this project. 

If you're here; those projects may also interest you! :)


## Requirements

- [Go]([https://go.dev/]) for doing the thing.
- [Just](https://just.systems/) for running scripts.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for docs generation. Easily sub for `npm` if preferred.

## Quick start


```bash
# Clone the repo
gh repo clone imdevan/go-cli-template
cd go-cli-template

# Just build and run
just build-run
```

## Using this as a template

This project is designed to be forked and adapted. The single source of truth for all project metadata is `internal/package/package.toml`. 
<br>
Changing it and running `just sync` propagates your values everywhere.

### Steps

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Edit `internal/package/package.toml` with your project details:

```toml
name        = "my-tool"
module      = "github.com/you/my-tool"
description = "What my tool does"
version     = "0.1.0"
repository  = "https://github.com/you/my-tool"
docs_site   = "https://you.github.io"
docs_base   = "/my-tool"
```

3. Run `just sync` to propagate changes.
4. Review the diff with `git diff`.
5. Build and verify: `just build && just test`

### What `just sync` updates

- Go module name in `go.mod` and all import paths throughout `internal/` and `cmd/`
- Binary name in the justfile and build scripts
- Config directory paths in `internal/utils/paths.go`
- Shell completion examples
- README description block
- Version constant in `cmd/*/root.go`

After syncing, add your own commands under `cmd/`, domain types under `internal/domain/`, and UI components under `internal/ui/`.

## Documentation

Documentation is built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and lives in `docs/`. Content is generated automatically from the Go source and project markdown files — you generally don't edit `docs/src/content/docs/` by hand.

However you can easily customize the look of your docs by editing the styles located in `docs/src/styles/custom.css`.

### Go Docs

Go docs are generated via [gomarkdoc](https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc)

Into **API Reference**

These docs are intended to be be seen only for the development of the project.

They contain the documentation for the development of the project; they are not needed by users of the cli tool you are building.

### readme, install, config, and contributing

These pages are pulled whole sale from the markdown files in the project. 
Frontmatter is added to play nice with Startlight.

### Commands `cmd`

These pages are generated from go doc comments from the `/cmd` folder which
contains all commands a potential user of the cli tool would use. 

As well as some bash scripting to pull out information on any flag params for a given command.

### How docs are generated

#### just docs-dev

Build the docs and watch for changes.

#### just docs-build

Build docs for production.

#### just docs-generate

Running `just docs-generate` (or implicitly via `just docs-dev` / `just docs-build`) runs `go-cli-docs generate`, which:

1. **Reads `internal/package/package.toml`** and writes `docs/config.mjs` and `docs/sidebar.mjs` with the current project name, description, repository URL, and base path.
2. **Imports markdown files** from the repository root:
   - `README.md` → `docs/src/content/docs/index.md`
   - `INSTALL.md` → `docs/src/content/docs/install.md`
   - `CONFIG.md` → `docs/src/content/docs/configuration.md`
3. **Generates command pages** by parsing each `cmd/<name>/*.go` file for `Use`, `Short`, flags, and godoc comments — one page per command under `docs/src/content/docs/commands/`.
4. **Generates API reference pages** using [gomarkdoc](https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc) for every package under `internal/` (including `internal/adapters/*`), outputting to `docs/src/content/docs/api/`.
    - The API reference is only rendered in the side bar during development. 
    - As it is internal and not pertinent to users of the cli tool, but still very helpful for maintainers

### API Reference visibility

The API Reference section is **internal** and only rendered in development by default. When you run `just docs-dev`, the sidebar includes all `internal/` package docs. In a production build (`NODE_ENV=production`), the API Reference is hidden — unless the project name is `go-cli-template`, in which case it is always shown as a live example.

This means when you use this template for your own project, your production docs site will be clean and user-facing, while you still get the full API reference locally during development.

```bash
just docs-dev      # Serves docs at http://localhost:4321 with API reference visible
just docs-build    # Builds production site — API reference hidden for non-template projects
```

## Architecture

Items marked `*` are updated by `just sync`.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/go-cli-template/config.toml` (typically `~/.config/go-cli-template/config.toml`).

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `editor` | string | `nvim` | Editor opened by `config` and other editor-aware commands |
| `interactive_default` | bool | `false` | Start in interactive TUI mode when no arguments are given |
| `list_spacing` | string | `space` | List density: `compact` (title only), `tight` (title + description), `space` (with margins) |
| `headings` | string | `15` | Heading color |
| `primary` | string | `02` | Primary accent color |
| `secondary` | string | `06` | Secondary accent color |
| `text` | string | `07` | Body text color |
| `text_highlight` | string | `06` | Highlighted text color |
| `description_highlight` | string | `05` | Highlighted description color |
| `tags` | string | `13` | Tags color |
| `flags` | string | `12` | Flags/key color |
| `muted` | string | `08` | Muted/dimmed text color |
| `border` | string | `08` | Border color |

Colors accept named values, terminal palette indices, or hex strings (e.g. `7`, `"#ff8800"`).

### How configuration flows through the project

- `internal/config` loads and parses `config.toml` at startup, providing a `Config` struct available to all commands.
- `internal/utils/paths.go` uses XDG paths derived from the project name to locate the config file.
- `internal/ui` reads color and spacing values from config to build Bubble Tea styles — all theme colors come from the loaded config rather than hardcoded constants.
- `internal/adapters/editor` uses the `editor` field to open files in the user's preferred editor.
- The `interactive_default` flag controls whether the root command drops into the TUI automatically or requires an explicit argument.

To generate a config file with defaults:

```bash
go-cli-template config init
go-cli-template config init --force    # Overwrite existing
go-cli-template config init --editor   # Create and open in editor
```

To edit the config directly:

```bash
go-cli-template config
```

See `CONFIG.md` for the full reference or `example-config.toml` for a ready-to-copy example.

## Installation

See `INSTALL.md` for installation options.

# Thank you!

This project was made by deconstructing another cli project of mine [Prompter](http://devan.gg/prompter-cli/). Check it out if you like fiddling with coding agents and want a more vim centric way of managing your prompting!
